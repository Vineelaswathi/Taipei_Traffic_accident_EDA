Step1: There are six main topics to be shown in each year:   

Number of traffic accident death toll per month   
Number of traffic accident injuries per month   
Number of traffic accident injuries per vehicle type (take the top 10)   
Number of traffic accident injuries per weather   
Number of traffic accident injuries per road pattern (take the top 10)   
Number of traffic accident injuries per accident location (take the top 10)
step2: Each topic will be presented by a bar chart.

Step3: For each year, use bar graph grid to show the six topics. Thus, there will be eight grids for years and each grid has six bar charts for each topic.

Step4: On the other hand, please produce the grids for the six topics respectively. Each grid will have eight bar charts for the eight years.

Step5: In each chart, I have the topic on the top and label the x-axis and y-axis.
